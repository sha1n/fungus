          # Actually, for OIDC specifically with NPM, we might need a slightly different setup if we don't use a token.
          # But many users still use a granular token with OIDC as a fallback or just for simplicity.
          # To go FULL OIDC (passwordless), we need to configure the 'id-token: write' permission and NPM should be configured to trust GitHub.
